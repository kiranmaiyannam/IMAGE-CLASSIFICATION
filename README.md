INTERN ID : CT2MTDM665

DOMAIN : Machine Learning

DURATION : 8 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH

# DESCRIPTION
This project implements an Image Classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The primary goal is to train a deep learning model that can classify images into predefined categories based on their visual features.

The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a widely used dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. This task is part of the internship assignment provided by CodTech and focuses on end-to-end implementation from data preprocessing to evaluation and visualization.
